    <p>I can remember when we walked together. Sharing a love I thought would last forever.</p> <!-- <p> will print the line to the user. Multiple are used to create new lines -->
    <p>Moonlight to show the way so we can follow. Waiting inside her eyes was my tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Then something changed her mind her kisses told me. I had no loving arms to hold me.</p>
    <p>Every day I wake up then I start to break up. Lonely is a man without love.</p>
    <p>Every day I start out then I cry my heart out. Lonely is a man without love.</p>
    <p>Every day I wake up then I start to break up knowing that it's cloudy above.</p>
    <p>Every day I start out then I cry my heart out. Lonely is a man without love.</p>
    <p>I cannot face this world that's falling down on me. So if you see my girl please send her home to me.</p>
    <p>Tell her about my heart that's slowly dying. Say I can't stop myself from crying.</p>
    <p>Every day I wake up then I start to break up. Lonely is a man without love.</p>
    <p>Every day I start out then I cry my heart out. Lonely is a man without love.</p>
    <p>Every day I wake up then I start to break up knowing that it's cloudy above.</p>
    <p>Every day I start out then I cry my heart out. Lonely is a man without love.</p>
    <p>Every day I wake up then I start to break up. Lonely is a man without love.</p>
    <p>Every day I start out then I cry my heart out. Lonely is a man without love.</p>
